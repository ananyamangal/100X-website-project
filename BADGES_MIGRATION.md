# Multiple Badges Feature Implementation

## Overview
This update implements support for multiple badges per product instead of a single badge. Admins can now add multiple badges to products, and they will be displayed appropriately across the website.

## Changes Made

### 1. Data Model Updates
- **Product Model** (`lib/productModel.ts`): Changed `badge: string` to `badges: string[]`
- **Admin Interface** (`app/admin/page.tsx`): Updated Product interface to use `badges: string[]`

### 2. Admin Panel Updates
- **Product Form**: Replaced single badge dropdown with multiple checkbox selection
- **Badge Selection**: Admins can now select multiple badges from a predefined list
- **Visual Feedback**: Selected badges are displayed as preview badges in the form
- **Product List**: Shows up to 3 badges with "+X more" indicator for additional badges

### 3. Frontend Display Updates
- **Product Cards** (`components/ProductCard.tsx`): Shows max 3 badges vertically with logos
- **Product Detail Page** (`app/products/[id]/page.tsx`): 
  - Shows all badges in the header section
  - Added dedicated "Product Certifications & Features" section with all badges in separate boxes
- **Homepage** (`app/page.tsx`): Updated to handle multiple badges
- **Products Page** (`app/products/page.tsx`): Automatically works with ProductCard updates

### 4. Badge Options Available
- Korean Technology
- German Technology
- Japnese Technology
- GeM
- Heavy Duty
- Eco Friendly
- Ecofreidly
- BIS Approved
- Best Seller
- Eco-Friendly
- New Launch
- Budget Friendly
- Precision Tech

### 5. Logo Mapping
Each badge can have an associated logo from the `/public/logos clipart 2/` directory:
- Korean Technology → Korean Technology.png
- German Technology → german technology.png
- Japnese Technology → Japnese technology.png
- GeM → GeM logo.png
- Heavy Duty → Heavy duty.png
- Eco Friendly/Ecofreidly → Ecofreidly.png
- BIS Approved → BIS approved.png

## Migration

### For Existing Products
Run the migration script to convert existing single badges to badges arrays:

```bash
node migrate-badges.js
```

This script will:
1. Find all products with a `badge` field
2. Convert the single badge to a `badges` array
3. Remove the old `badge` field
4. Log the migration progress

### Manual Migration
If you prefer to migrate manually, update each product document:
```javascript
// Old structure
{ badge: "Best Seller" }

// New structure
{ badges: ["Best Seller"] }
```

## Admin Access
- Admin panel is accessible via the link in the footer
- Password: `dtu@ananya`
- URL: `/admin`

## Features

### Product Cards
- **Max 3 badges** displayed vertically on the left side
- **Logos included** for each badge
- **"+X more" indicator** when there are more than 3 badges

### Product Detail Pages
- **All badges shown** in the header section
- **Dedicated section** "Product Certifications & Features" with all badges in separate boxes
- **Logos displayed** alongside each badge

### Admin Panel
- **Multiple selection** via checkboxes
- **Visual preview** of selected badges
- **Easy management** of product badges

## Backward Compatibility
The code includes fallbacks to handle both old (`badge`) and new (`badges`) data structures:
```javascript
(product.badges || [product.badge])
```

This ensures the website continues to work during the migration period.

## Testing
1. Access the admin panel
2. Edit an existing product or create a new one
3. Select multiple badges using the checkboxes
4. Save the product
5. Verify the badges display correctly on:
   - Product cards (max 3)
   - Product detail page (all badges)
   - Homepage featured products
